# FractalFun

This is a simple fractal demo. Choose between Mandelbrot or the Julia set with c = -0.7269 + 0.1889i. 

## What are the Mandelbrot and Julia set?

These are examples of fractal structures generated in the complex plane by means of repeated function iteration.
This is a very loose explanation. For more thorough information, please see:

[Wikipedia:Julia Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set "Julia set")

## What do the colors mean

There are many ways of coloring the fractals. Roughly speaking, the black parts are members of the respective fractal set, and color denote rate of divergence.
The specific method used in this application is based on the following:
